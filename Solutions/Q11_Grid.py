"""Suppose you have a grid of n x m cells, where each cell is either empty or contains a
rock. You're given a starting position in the grid (x,y), and you want to reach a target
position (tx,ty), but you can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right) and you
can only move through empty cells.You're also given a limited number of moves k
that you can make. Write a program to determine if it's possible to reach the target
position from the starting position within k moves."""
